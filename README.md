3D Printable Tablet Case for Framework Laptop

Hi all, 

So I just finished modeling up a concept for a Framework tablet. 

The ethos being make as few changes as possible to make it work. In this case, I've used as many OEM Framework parts as possible. Only going to amazon for a portable touchscreen display and a ribbon USB c cable to connect the display to the motherboard. The whole thing is held together with M3 screws and heat inserts to the 3d printed case.

I've attached some pictures and a the step file for you to review. 

Please note, this is a first draft and it may not work. I do not currently own a framework laptop so i am unable to test the part fitment myself. 

I look forward to everyone's feedback.
