# Framework-Tablet
3D Printable Tablet Case for Framework Laptop

The ethos for this project being is to make as few changes as possible to convert a Framework Laptop to a tablet form factor. In this case, I've used as many OEM Framework parts as possible.

The whole thing is held together with M3 fasteners and heat set inserts.

## Assembly

Build Instructions: Coming Soon! 

To help organize parts for this project, you can also print my free [Framework parts tray](https://www.printables.com/model/253099-framework-parts-tray)

For assembly, you will need the following:

- 25 M3 heat inserts (short)
- 8 M3 x 4mm screws
- 7 M3 x 8mm screws
- 6 M3 x 16mm screws
- 4 M3 x 5mm screws

This tablet case is based on a 12.3-inch display [external display](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08P1M54G6/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_4?smid=AA3SELAX5GFYF&psc=1)

To connect the display to the Motherboard, you will need a USB C 3.1. The cable must be able to provide power, data, and input. I used the following: [USB C Cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PTYKV6N?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)


# Print Settings:

I recommend printing all case parts of either ASA or ABS as this provides the best heat resistance.

This case is designed to be printed at 0.2mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle.

No printed supports are needed in printing. All holes have built-in supports. STLs are properly oriented for correct printing.

The case is 317.2mm x 224mm x 24.6mm, so you will need a printer that can accommodate that size. I printed mine on a Voron 2.4 350mm

In addition to the Tablet case, you will find a wall dock and desktop dock to use in desktop mode or attached to an external monitor.

I've uploaded the step files for the model as well, so you can modify the frame to accept any screen you'd like.

I look forward to everyone's feedback.
