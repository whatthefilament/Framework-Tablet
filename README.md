# Framework-Tablet
3D Printable Tablet Case for Framework Laptop
 

This project is currently in beta as the design has not been fully tested and finalized 

The ethos for this project being make as few changes as possible to make it work. In this case, I've used as many OEM Framework parts as possible.

The whole thing is held together with M3 screws and heat inserts to the 3d printed case.

I've attached some pictures and a the step file for you to review. 

This tablet case is based around a 12.3 inch display (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08P1M54G6/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_4?smid=AA3SELAX5GFYF&psc=1)

To connect the display to the Motherboard you will need a USB C 3.1 or faster cable. It power and input. I use th needs to be capable of data,e following: 

USB C Cable - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PTYKV6N?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

For assembly you will need the following: 

- 21 M3 heat inserts
- 8 M3 x 4mm screws
- 6 M3 x 16mm screws
- 7 M3 x 8mm screws

Print Settings: 

I recommened printing all case parts of either ASA or ABS as this provides the best heat resistance. 

This case is designed to be printed at 0.2mm layer height wtih a 0.4mm nozzle. 

No supports are needed in printing. All holes have built in supports. STl's are properly oriented for correct printing 

The case is 317.2mm x 224mm x  24.6mm so you will need a printer that can accomodate that size. I printed mine on a Voron 2.4 350mm

I've uploaded the step files for the model as well so you can modify the frame to accept any screen you'd like. 

I look forward to everyone's feedback.
